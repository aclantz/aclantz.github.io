            <h3>The Goal:</h3>
            <p>
              To build a server-side component for a “movies” web application.
              Giving me experience building a database, layers of business
              logic, and REST API. This project will be the base that I will
              connect two frontend projects, a completed MERN tech stack with a
              React movies application, and an Angular movies application.

                This project will demonstrate my mastery of full-stack JavaScript
                development, including APIs, web server frameworks, databases,
                business logic, authentication, and data security.

        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p>
          This process began with building our HTTP request endpoints. I learned
          how these endpoints would be the way that our frontend would connect
          to the database. Which then allowed us to focus on learning about
          databases. We focused on a nonSQL database and used MongoDB to start
          making the structure. I didn’t know it at the time but this is when I
          would make a choice that would effect me for the rest of the process.
          Organizing the data we were creating and choosing the layout of that
          structure I did not make clear choices about capitalization of
          key-value pairs. This is a lesson I have paid for and learned as I
          struggled through connecting my frontend applications to this backend
          component.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applying business logic to our backend Allowed me to take some control
          of my mistake as we applied models for our data formalizing the data
          structure and how it was being implemented. As I built my
          documentation I also tried to be more clear about when the keys were
          capitalized and when they were not. This was not a big problem but I
          was surprised by how often I had to go back and fix something from
          such a small choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          We deployed our project to Heroku, I had trouble understand the
          directions we were given for deployment and was struggling to deploy
          successfully. I ended up connecting with a friend who is a developer
          and we worked on it together and found a work around to deploy
          manually instead of automatically. This was my first time co-working
          with a developer on something and made me excited to work with a team.
        </p>
        <h3>The Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
          I successfully built my REST API and linked it with my React
          application and later an Angular application. I learned how
          documentation of an API is so important. Returning to my documentation
          was essential for me as shifted my mindset to the client side of this
          application. I overall enjoyed working on the backend of a project and
          I hope to continue this kind of work with something new.
