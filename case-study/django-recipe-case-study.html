            <h3>The Goal:</h3>
            <p>
              Build a full-stack web application with Django framework to manage
              recipes. Providing user friendly interface where users can sig up,
              log in, create, modify, and search for recipes.

              <p>Career Foundry, Python for Web-Dev, Achievement 2</p>
              <p>
                To develop a full-stack application focusing on Django for the
                backend and python, html, css for the front end. Challenging me
                to build a multi-user application applying coding best
                practices.

                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Django</li>

        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p>
          I started this process by building a purely python command line
          application that allowed you to create, delete, edit, and update
          recipes. This was how I first learned how to use Python and and
          exploring the difference in syntax between javascript and python I
          found python to be very accessible. After creating this it was time to
          update the application so that it would be a full-stack web app. I
          used Django to manage the process, taking advantage of its built in
          sql database, middleware, and query formatting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Figuring out the “Django way” of doing things was a definite
          transition. I struggled with visualizing in my head how everything was
          being connected. Comparing it to React and Angular made it feel much
          more complicated, and with the other two I was always able to keep a
          mental image of the file organization, Once I let this go and trusted
          the process a bit more I grew more comfortable with organizational
          method of Django.

          alt="screen shot of event details button" />
        <p>
          One of my struggles was to build a search function that returned a
          Pandas dataFrame, I understood the use of the data frame and how to
          query the correct recipe data, but I wanted to have a list of all
          recipes and their ingredients displayed before any search was made.
          This required me to query all the recipes in its own variable
          “recipes” and then when a search was made (POST request) I would
          define another variable with the search query parameters “qs” and
          display those. In my template I then used a conditional format to call
          “qs” if available and “recipes” if not. The logic of this programming
          was clear to me it then took me a while to practice and comfortably
          intact it with python/django syntax.
        </p>
        <h3>The Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
          A full-stack Recipe application! I am proud of the aesthetics of the
          app and functionality. I think what I gained most from the experience
          was experience using Django and also practicing the skill of using
          programming principals and applying them to the language and framework
          I am currently working in. I find the more I shift through different
          languages and frameworks the more I feel the core programming
          principals sink in.
