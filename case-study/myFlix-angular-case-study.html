          The same myFlix application I built before, this time with Angular
          instead of React.

        <p>
          Using Angular to rebuild the myFlix application I had built using
          React. This allowed me to explore a different framework in an
          application I already knew a lot about. Angular provides a very
          different framework, especially in how you pass information between
          components. I found data bindings to be confusing at the start but
          once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed the ease with which I could move
          data through an application.

          Again, I learned the lesson of high quality documentation being so
          important after having to return to my own API. Clear documentation
          is such an integral part of development.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Your app should display a welcome view where users will be able to
              either log in or register an account.
            </li>
            <li>Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies.</li>
            <li>
              Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a
              single movie view, where additional movie details will be
              displayed. The single movie view will contain the following
              additional features:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view,
                  where details about the director of that particular movie will
                  be displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view,
                  where details about that particular genre of the movie will be
                  displayed.
                </li>
              </ul>
