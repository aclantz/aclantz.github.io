            <h3>The Goal:</h3>
            <p>
              To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
              that loads from an external API and enables the viewing of data
              points in detail.

              <h3>The Purpose:</h3>
              <p>Career Foundry, Full-Stack Immersion, Achievement 1</p>
              <p>
                To build my first full web application, including high-quality
                HTML and CSS. An introduction into JavaScript and learning how
                to access an external API.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="opening-tools">
              <h3 class="tools--title">The Tools:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p>
          This started with a deep dive into Javascript and learning how to
          really use this language for the first time. Focusing on basics like
          operators, loops, functions, and the DOM. We learned how to manipulate
          the DOM which for me was when I really got the first taste of how much
          was possible with Javascript. I had such a clear idea form the
          beginning of what I wanted this application to look like and I kept
          thinking of new elements I wanted to add in. I loved the feeling of
          building elements through Javascript and manipulating the DOM to
          display them right away.
        </p>

          alt="screen shot of mongo DB movie collection" />
        <p>
          I got my first taste of reading documentation and learning how to
          interact with external data, through this whole course clear
          documentation was something I learned to appreciate. We also started
          to work with asynchronous functions and promises. This was my first
          stumbling block that took me a moment to comprehend but after pushing
          and working through I became more comfortable with promises.
        </p>
        <h3>The Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
          I am very happy with this application and I think I will always feel
          very attached and proud of it as being the first “real” application I
          ever built. I still have a lot of ideas of ways I could make it grow
          into a fuller pokemon database. I still play pokemon (I love nuzloche
          challenges) and I would love to develop some more features like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Colored button matching pokemon's "type"</li>
          <li>Show a lot more data when pokemon is selected</li>
          <li>Be able to save pokemon into teams and view them</li>
          <li>
            Branch out into other generations of pokemon instead of the original
            150
          </li>
        </ul>
