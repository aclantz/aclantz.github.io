            <h3>The Goal:</h3>
            <p>
              To build a full front to back application that allows users to
              create a profile, view a database of movies, and save some as
              favorites. Once connected to my backend API, this will be a
              complete MERN stack application.

              <h3>The Purpose:</h3>
              <p>Career Foundry, Full-Stack Immersion, Achievement 3</p>
              <p>
                To connect to the movies API I had already built in a previous
                achievement and build a front end architecture using React. This
                was my first opportunity exploring React and learning the basics
                of how it functions.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="opening-tools">
              <h3 class="tools--title">The Tools:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Parcel</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                <li>propTypes</li>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>The Process:</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first time working through using React as a framework so I
          was learning the fundamentals at the beginning. Once I got in the
          swing of things and started to understand what "States" and "props"
          really meant and how to use them, I really started to enjoy how React
          works. I love structure so to have a specified structure to work
          within felt great.
        </p>
        <img
          src="../img/case-study/myFlix-app2.png"
          alt="screen shot of a movie's details page" />
        <p>
          My first challenge was building a search function allowing users to
          search for movies within the database and then go to that movie's
          specified details page. It took me a while to figure out how to access
          the database in a search and then if successful send the user to the
          details page. This was the moment when the idea of passing props
          through child components clicked. I knew I didn’t want to fully search
          my database for a match and since I had already retrieved all my movie
          data in my MainView component, I passed movies to the Search
          component and was then able to search for a match in there. It feels
          silly and obvious writing it now but I can see how this was the
          moment when I fell in love with React.

        <h3>The Outcome:</h3>
        <p>
          I am proud of my first full back to front application. I could feel
          myself not just learning the skills to build with React but also
          starting to actually understand programming and how that can translate
          into any framework. I would love to revisit this application and
          improve upon the “favorite-ing” structure and add a visible element
          for the user to see if the movie is already favorited or not.
