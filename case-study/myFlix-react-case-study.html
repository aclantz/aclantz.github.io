          This is the first full front- and back-end application I ever built,
          using Node, Express, MongoDB, and React.

        <h2>Back-End</h2>
        <p>
          Building a server-side application using Node, Express, and MongoDB. I
          learned about the infrastructure of back-end applications (e.g., Server
          -> Business Logic -> Data Base). Building my own Database of movies
          and making sure to organize my data accurately and consistently. We
          were directed to work with a nonSQL database and to build our data
          using AI to help create the mock data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then created the business logic and server functions. Creating
          endpoints for HTTP requests and learning about READ, PUT, POST, DELETE
          requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Front-End</h2>
        <p>
          This was my first time working with React. Once I got over the
          learning curve, I fell in love with react. I enjoy the passing of data
          and using states to store information. I had a vision right away for
          how I wanted this application to look and was very excited to build it
          into what I was looking for.
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned the value of clear documentation now that I needed to
          interact with my own API. Many lessons were learned as I initially
          struggled to connect to the endpoints that I built. I ended up going
          back and redefining my documentation to make it more clear.
